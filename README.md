# WinForm - Cleanup Application

WinForm is a cleanup application written in C++ CLR WinForm. It is designed to help users remove temporary files, browser cookies, prefetch files, and perform Windows update cleanup. This application provides a simple and user-friendly interface for managing and cleaning up various types of files that accumulate on Windows systems.

## Features

- **Temporary Files Cleanup:** WinForm allows users to clean up temporary files generated by the operating system and applications. These files are often left behind after software installations, system updates, or browsing the web.
- **Browser Cookies Removal:** This application enables users to remove cookies stored by web browsers. By deleting unnecessary cookies, users can enhance their privacy and free up storage space.
- **Prefetch Files Cleanup:** Prefetch files are created by Windows to optimize the startup process and improve application launch times. WinForm can clear these files, helping to maintain system performance.
- **Windows Update Cleanup:** Over time, Windows accumulates update files that are no longer needed. WinForm identifies and removes such files, freeing up disk space.
